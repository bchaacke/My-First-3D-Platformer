# Overview

This is a really simple 3D platformer. I created it in order to learn how to use Unity. 

The goal of the game is simple: get to the end of the level without falling off the platforms.

Use the WASD keys to move around, and the spacebar to jump. Use the mouse to look around.

A software demo video is included in the repository next to this README document.

# Development Environment

This was my first time using Unity. I had to learn how to create and manipulate objects, how to interact with the in-engine physics, how to make a script in C#, how to use Unity's particle creator, and more.

I used C# to make all of the scripts. I made the camera move smoothly with the mouse. I made the player move smoothly when you press the WASD keys. I made the player detect the ground so it knows if it can jump when you hit the spacebar. I also had to detect if the player makes it to the end of the level.
